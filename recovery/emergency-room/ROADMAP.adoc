Roadmap for A&E: panic-safe intake, stabilisation, evidence capture, and calm handoff within AmbientOps.

== Phase 0 — Bootstrap

Deliverables:

* Repo structure + governance + CI
* Safety guarantees and scope documentation
* Contract dependencies identified (`system-tools-contracts`)

== Phase 1 — Specs and seams

Deliverables:

* Incident bundle definition:
  - evidence envelope fields
  - run-bundle folder layout
  - redaction hints
* Safety posture vocabulary (non-destructive defaults)
* Handoff intents:
  - Ward deep-link
  - Operating Theatre scan/plan request
  - Network Recovery Unit handoff
  - Records export / feedback-a-tron message intent
* Profile behaviours (general/dev/technician/child)

== Phase 2 — MVP (one platform first)

Deliverables:

* One-click launcher entry (desktop/menu)
* Local incident bundle creation
* Minimal prompts (“what are you seeing?”)
* Safe stabilisation set:
  - disk pressure relief (safe cache options)
  - process pressure relief (guided)
  - memory pressure reporting (guided)
  - network quick check + handoff
* Dry-run + headless modes

== Phase 3 — Integrations

Deliverables:

* Ward: return link + status + one next step
* Operating Theatre: create scan/plan requests and attach bundle references
* Systems Observatory: request “context window” summary for the incident
* Records: generate a compact “incident receipt” summary
* feedback-a-tron: redaction-aware share bundle message intent

== Phase 4 — Cross-platform packaging

Deliverables:

* Windows/Linux/macOS launchers (best effort)
* Optional file manager context actions
* Consistent UX patterns across OSes

== Phase 5 — Hardening

Deliverables:

* Conformance tests against `system-tools-contracts`
* Robust error handling (“best effort capture”)
* Privacy self-audit checklist and local-only verification mode
