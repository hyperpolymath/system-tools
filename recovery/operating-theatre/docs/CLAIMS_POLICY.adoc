This document defines what claims Operating Theatre and AmbientOps tools are permitted to make, and how those claims must be supported.

== Claim Categories

=== Space Claims

Claims about disk space:

[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Claim Type | Requirement | Example

| Space recovered
| Must measure actual bytes freed
| "Freed 1.2GB from temp files"

| Space available
| Must use OS API accurately
| "47GB free of 500GB"

| Space by category
| Must enumerate actual files
| "Downloads: 12GB in 847 files"
|===

==== Forbidden Space Claims

* "Could free up to X" without actual measurement
* Claiming potential space without scanning
* Rounding up aggressively
* Counting the same space multiple times

=== Performance Claims

Claims about system speed:

[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Claim Type | Requirement | Example

| Boot time
| Must measure actual boot time
| "Boot time: 42 seconds"

| Startup impact
| Must measure with/without
| "This app adds ~3s to boot"

| Memory usage
| Must use OS metrics
| "Chrome: 1.2GB across 12 processes"
|===

==== Forbidden Performance Claims

* "Registry cleaning improves performance"
* "Speed up your PC by X%" (without measurement)
* "Remove errors to improve speed"
* Any benchmark not actually performed

=== Security Claims

Claims about security status:

[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Claim Type | Requirement | Example

| Vulnerability present
| CVE reference or equivalent
| "CVE-2024-1234 affects installed version"

| Security update available
| OS/vendor API confirmation
| "Windows security update KB5034441 pending"

| Exposure detected
| Verifiable evidence
| "Port 3389 open to internet (RDP)"
|===

==== Forbidden Security Claims

* "Your computer is at risk" (without specific evidence)
* Generic "security issues found" counts
* Implying danger from cosmetic issues
* Claiming security benefit from cleanup

=== Count Claims

Claims about numbers of items:

[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Claim Type | Requirement | Example

| Files found
| Actual enumeration
| "Found 1,234 temp files"

| Issues found
| Distinct, meaningful issues
| "3 items to review"

| Items cleaned
| Actual items processed
| "Removed 847 files"
|===

==== Forbidden Count Claims

* Inflating by counting sub-items
* "5,847 registry errors" (meaningless metric)
* Counting potential issues as actual
* Combining unrelated counts for larger number

== Claim Evidence Requirements

Every claim must be backed by evidence in the Evidence Envelope.

=== Evidence Levels

[cols="1,2,3",options="header"]
|===
| Level | Description | When Required

| **L1: Direct**
| Exact measurement or enumeration
| All claims about specific values

| **L2: Derived**
| Calculated from L1 evidence
| Summaries, aggregations

| **L3: Inferred**
| Logical conclusion from evidence
| Recommendations, correlations
|===

=== Evidence Format

[source,json]
----
{
  "claim": {
    "type": "space_recovered",
    "value": 1288490188,
    "unit": "bytes",
    "human_readable": "1.2GB"
  },
  "evidence": {
    "level": "L1",
    "method": "file_enumeration_and_deletion",
    "artifacts": [
      {
        "artifact_id": "uuid-1",
        "description": "List of deleted files with sizes",
        "hash": "sha256:abc..."
      }
    ],
    "verification": {
      "reproducible": true,
      "command": "sysobs verify-claim --receipt-id xyz"
    }
  }
}
----

== Severity Mapping

Claims must use appropriate severity:

[cols="1,3,1",options="header"]
|===
| Claim Type | Severity Criteria | Max Default

| Temp files exist
| Size-based (>1GB = Medium)
| Low

| Startup items
| Impact-based (>5s = Medium)
| Low

| Disk space low
| Percentage (<10% = High)
| High

| Security update missing
| Criticality of update
| Critical

| Old browser cache
| Age and size
| Info

| Duplicate files
| User review needed
| Info
|===

== Forbidden Claim Patterns

The following claim patterns are explicitly forbidden:

=== Inflation Patterns

* "5,847 registry errors" — Registry entries are not "errors"
* "Performance degraded by 47%" — Unmeasured claim
* "Critical issues detected" — For non-critical findings
* "Your PC is slower than 89% of users" — Fake comparison

=== Pressure Patterns

* "Fix now before it's too late"
* "These issues are getting worse"
* "Other users fixed these issues"
* Any countdown or urgency timer

=== Vague Patterns

* "Issues found" without specifics
* "Problems detected" without evidence
* "Errors" for non-error conditions
* "Risks" without specific threat

== Language Standards

=== Allowed Phrases

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Instead of | Use

| "5,847 errors found!"
| "Found 3 items to review"

| "Your PC is at CRITICAL risk!"
| "1 security update available"

| "Speed up your PC!"
| "Startup time: 42 seconds"

| "Clean registry for performance"
| (Don't make this claim at all)

| "Problems detected"
| "Disk space: 85% used"
|===

=== Tone Guidelines

* Neutral, informative tone
* Specific over vague
* Measured over estimated
* Conservative over aggressive
* Educational over alarming

== Compliance Checking

Claims are checked at multiple points:

=== Development Time

* CI checks for banned phrases
* Schema validation for claim structure
* Evidence reference validation

=== Runtime

* Severity validation against criteria
* Evidence completeness check
* Count inflation detection

=== Pack Certification

* Claims audit for new packs
* Evidence chain verification
* User testing for clarity
