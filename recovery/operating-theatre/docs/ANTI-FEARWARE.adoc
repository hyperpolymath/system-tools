This document defines the anti-fearware design principles that govern Operating Theatre (big-up) and all related AmbientOps system tools.

== The Problem: Fearware

Traditional "system optimizer" tools use dark patterns to:

* **Inflate problem counts** — "5,847 registry errors found!"
* **Create urgency** — countdown timers, flashing warnings
* **Mislead about impact** — "Your PC is at CRITICAL risk!"
* **Obscure actual changes** — "Cleaned 2.3GB!" (of what?)
* **Push unnecessary purchases** — "Upgrade to fix these issues!"

These tactics exploit users' legitimate concerns about their computers.

== Our Commitment: Anti-Fearware

Operating Theatre and all AmbientOps tools commit to the opposite approach.

=== Core Principles

[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Principle | What It Means | How We Enforce It

| **Evidence-First**
| Every finding must have verifiable evidence
| Findings reference specific files, metrics, or logs

| **Honest Severity**
| Severity matches actual impact
| "Info" for cosmetic, "High" only for real problems

| **No Fake Counts**
| Numbers represent real, distinct issues
| No inflating by counting sub-items separately

| **Transparent Actions**
| Users see exactly what will change
| Preview before apply, diff after

| **Reversibility-First**
| Prefer actions that can be undone
| Backups before changes, undo bundles always

| **No Dark Patterns**
| No manipulation tactics
| No countdowns, no fear copy, no fake urgency
|===

=== What We Will NEVER Do

* Display inflated "error counts" or "issues found"
* Use countdown timers to pressure decisions
* Show fake "scanning" animations for effect
* Claim "registry cleaning improves performance"
* Display warnings about non-problems
* Auto-download or install third-party software
* Use scare tactics like "CRITICAL" for minor issues
* Require payment to see what was "found"
* Show "before/after" metrics without evidence
* Claim speed improvements without measurement

=== What We WILL Do

* Show evidence for every finding
* Explain in plain language what each issue means
* Let users make informed decisions at their pace
* Provide clear undo paths for all changes
* Generate receipts documenting what was checked and changed
* Be transparent about what we can and cannot determine
* Acknowledge uncertainty when appropriate
* Respect user time and attention

== Severity Classification

Severity levels must accurately reflect actual impact:

[cols="1,2,3",options="header"]
|===
| Level | Criteria | Examples

| **Info**
| No action required; informational only
| "Windows Update pending", "Disk 70% full"

| **Low**
| Minor optimization opportunity
| "Unused startup entry", "Old temp files"

| **Medium**
| Worth addressing but not urgent
| "Outdated driver available", "Large log accumulation"

| **High**
| Should be addressed soon
| "Disk 95% full", "Critical security update missing"

| **Critical**
| Immediate attention required
| "Disk full", "Known malware signature detected"
|===

=== Severity Anti-Patterns (Forbidden)

* Marking cosmetic issues as "High" or "Critical"
* Inflating severity to encourage action
* Using "Critical" for performance suggestions
* Marking old files as security risks without evidence

== UI/UX Requirements

=== Language Guidelines

DO use:

* "Found 3 items to review"
* "Disk usage: 85GB of 100GB (85%)"
* "This startup program slows boot by ~3 seconds"
* "Optional: remove unused language packs (saves ~500MB)"

DO NOT use:

* "5,847 ERRORS DETECTED!"
* "Your computer is at RISK!"
* "CRITICAL: Action required immediately!"
* "Performance degraded by 47%!" (unmeasured)

=== Visual Design

* No red flashing elements
* No countdown timers
* No progress bars that move faster at the end
* No fake "deep scan" animations
* Calm, professional appearance
* Clear distinction between Info/Warning/Action states

=== Decision Points

When users must make choices:

* Present options neutrally
* Default to the safer/reversible option
* Never auto-select the more aggressive action
* Allow "Skip" or "Decide later" without penalty
* No guilt-tripping for conservative choices

== Evidence Requirements

Every finding MUST include:

[source,json]
----
{
  "finding_id": "disk-low-space-001",
  "severity": "high",
  "category": "disk",
  "title": "Low disk space on C:",
  "evidence_refs": ["artifact-uuid-1", "artifact-uuid-2"],
  "evidence_summary": "85GB used of 100GB (85%)",
  "measurement_method": "Windows GetDiskFreeSpaceEx API",
  "recommendation": "Review large files or uninstall unused programs",
  "auto_fixable": false
}
----

=== Evidence Chain

. **Artifact**: Raw collected data (file list, metric value, log entry)
. **Reference**: UUID linking finding to artifact
. **Summary**: Human-readable interpretation
. **Method**: How the measurement was taken
. **Confidence**: Certainty level of the finding

== Receipts

Every scan and every apply action produces a receipt:

=== Receipt Contents (Minimum)

. What was checked (scope)
. When it was checked (timestamp)
. What was found (findings with evidence refs)
. What was changed (actions taken)
. What was NOT changed (and why)
. How to undo (if applicable)
. Full artifact references

=== Receipt Integrity

* Receipts are cryptographically signed
* Artifacts are content-addressed (hash-based)
* Receipts reference exact artifact versions
* Tampering is detectable

== Compliance Verification

Packs and modules must pass anti-fearware compliance checks:

=== Pack Claims

Every pack declares:

[source,json]
----
{
  "claims": {
    "no_fake_counts": true,
    "evidence_backed": true,
    "user_controlled": true,
    "fully_reversible": false,
    "open_source": true
  }
}
----

=== Automated Checks

* Finding severity matches criteria
* All findings have evidence_refs
* No banned phrases in UI text
* Reversibility accurately declared
* No countdown or pressure UI elements
