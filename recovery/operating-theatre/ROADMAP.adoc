Development roadmap for Operating Room (formerly big-up): the plan-first “doer” in the AmbientOps ecosystem.

== Current state

[cols="1,2,1",options="header"]
|===
| Phase | Focus | Status

| Phase 0
| Infrastructure + governance
| ✓ Complete

| Phase 1
| Specifications + contracts
| ⏳ In Progress

| Phase 2
| MVP implementation (Scan→Plan→Apply→Undo→Receipt)
| ⏳ Started (basic CLI)

| Phase 3
| Packs/adapters + integrations + packaging
| 🔲 Not Started

| Phase 4
| Release + distribution
| 🔲 Not Started
|===

== Phase 0: Infrastructure (complete)

Deliverables:

* Multi-forge mirroring (GitHub → GitLab, Codeberg, Bitbucket)
* Instant-sync automation on push/release
* Governance policy in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
* Initial repo structure

== Phase 1: Specifications & contracts (pending)

Deliverables:

* Feature specifications (what we do / do not do)
* CLI interface definitions (verbs + stable flags)
* Security model (least privilege, logging, reversibility)
* Evidence formats:
  - Evidence Envelope (scan output)
  - Plan format (approved steps)
  - Run bundle layout (folders + naming)
  - Receipt format (human-readable + machine-readable)
* Pack system spec:
  - pack manifest
  - capability detection
  - just-in-time install prompts (later if packs are separate repos)
* Ecosystem seam files (as needed): `STATE.scm` / `META.scm` / `ECOSYSTEM.scm`

== Phase 2: Core MVP (Scan→Plan→Apply→Undo→Receipt)

=== Current implementation

Basic `sor` CLI with system maintenance commands:

* `optimize` - System optimization (NVIDIA, firewall, journal, network)
* `cleanup` - Cache and temp file cleaning
* `sync` - Repository synchronization
* `check` - Check repos for uncommitted changes
* `analyze` - GitHub workflow failure analysis
* `pages` - GitHub Pages status check

=== Remaining deliverables

* Core CLI:
  - `detect`, `scan`, `plan`, `apply`, `undo`, `receipt`, `export`
* Plan engine:
  - produces a plan with preview + reversibility labels
  - refuses to apply without explicit approval
* Apply runner:
  - executes step-by-step with robust logging
  - captures exit codes + evidence artifacts
* Undo system:
  - undo tokens generated during apply
  - clear labeling: reversible / partial / not reversible
* Receipt generator:
  - “what checked”, “what changed”, “what not changed (and why)”
  - includes evidence pointers and undo instructions
* One “Typical” safe pack implemented end-to-end (pick one OS first)

== Phase 3: Packs, adapters, integrations, packaging

Deliverables:

* Safe packs (Typical):
  - Windows-safe, Linux-safe, macOS-safe (order by priority)
* Technician pack (Expert-gated):
  - Windows-tech (DISM/SFC workflows etc.) with strict warnings + receipts
* Adapters:
  - user-supplied external tool integration where useful (no bundling)
* Integrations:
  - AmbientOps “Ward” deep-links into plans
  - PSA handoff for “Crisis Mode”
  - JuliaDashboard timeline ingest of run bundles
  - feedback-a-tron message intents + redaction presets
  - HAR policy-gated execution hooks (optional)
* Packaging:
  - installers and/or portable builds per OS
  - (optional) Guix/Nix definitions as secondary distribution paths

== Phase 4: Release & distribution

Deliverables:

* v0.1.0 release: MVP + one safe pack + receipts/undo
* Release automation (changelog, signed artifacts/hashes)
* User docs (calm, non-fearware tone)
* Contribution guide for packs/themes/adapters

== Technology decision (resolved for now)

*Primary:* **D** (core implementation)
*Targeted components:* **Rust** (privileged/safety-critical helpers), when needed.

This keeps development fast while reserving Rust for the most sensitive execution paths.

== Contributing

Contributions are welcome once Phase 1 specifications land.

All contributions must:

* follow repository policy in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
* avoid fearware claims and dark patterns
* keep scan non-mutating; apply explicit; undo + receipt mandatory
