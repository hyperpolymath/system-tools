# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free, emotionally safe, and welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community that prioritizes **emotional safety** alongside technical excellence.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behaviors

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

✅ **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people
✅ **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
✅ **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
✅ **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
✅ **Focusing on what is best** for the overall community
✅ **Respecting reversibility** - accepting that code can be undone, experiments can fail
✅ **Practicing calm communication** - proportional responses, asynchronous by default
✅ **Valuing emotional safety** - acknowledging that anxiety is a valid concern
✅ **Supporting experimentation** - creating psychological safety for trying new approaches
✅ **Celebrating learning** - failures are opportunities, not flaws

### Unacceptable Behaviors

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

❌ **The use of sexualized language or imagery**, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
❌ **Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments**, and personal or political attacks
❌ **Public or private harassment**
❌ **Publishing others' private information** without explicit permission (physical or email addresses)
❌ **Shaming experiments or failures** - we celebrate learning
❌ **Dismissing emotional safety concerns** - anxiety and stress are valid
❌ **Demanding immediate responses** - asynchronous communication is the default
❌ **Creating artificial urgency** - unless truly critical
❌ **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate** in a professional setting

## Emotional Safety Principles

### Calm Code, Calm Community (CCCP)

This project follows the **Calm Code, Calm Community** manifesto:

1. **Reversibility Over Permanence**
   - Code can be undone
   - Experiments are encouraged
   - Mistakes are learning opportunities
   - No permanent consequences for good-faith contributions

2. **Asynchronous Over Immediate**
   - Responses don't need to be instant
   - Take time to think
   - No expectation of 24/7 availability
   - Respect time zones and schedules

3. **Proportional Responses**
   - Match response intensity to actual severity
   - Small issues → small responses
   - Avoid escalation
   - Practice de-escalation

4. **Psychological Safety**
   - Safe to ask questions
   - Safe to admit mistakes
   - Safe to say "I don't know"
   - Safe to experiment and fail

5. **Glanceable Communication**
   - Clear subject lines
   - Concise messages
   - Structured content
   - Easy to skim

### Emotional Temperature

We measure and value **emotional temperature**:

- **Low temperature** (Calm): Thoughtful, measured, constructive
- **Medium temperature** (Engaged): Passionate but controlled debate
- **High temperature** (Hot): Defensive, aggressive, unproductive

**Goal:** Maintain low-to-medium temperature through:
- Pausing before responding to heated topics
- Using "I" statements instead of "you" accusations
- Asking clarifying questions before assuming intent
- Taking breaks when temperature rises

---

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders (see [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md)) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Code reviews
- Documentation
- Communication channels (if established)
- In-person or virtual events

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces (conferences, social media, etc.).

---

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

- **GitHub Issues** (public, non-sensitive): Label with `conduct`
- **Security Advisory** (private, sensitive): https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/jusys/security/advisories/new

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Confidentiality

All reports will be kept confidential. Details shared with other maintainers will be minimized to only what is necessary for investigation and resolution.

---

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
