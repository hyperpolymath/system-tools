Development roadmap for System Observatory: the observability layer for AmbientOps.

== Phase 0 — Bootstrap (current)

Deliverables:

* Repo structure + governance + CI
* README with scope and constraints
* Contract dependencies identified (`system-tools-contracts`)
* Language decision: Elixir (primary) + Julia (analytics)

== Phase 1 — Specifications

Deliverables:

* Metrics schema (what we collect, how we store)
* Run bundle ingestion format
* Recommendation output format
* Dashboard data model
* Timeline event schema

== Phase 2 — Core MVP

Deliverables:

* Metrics store (time series)
* Run bundle ingestion from Operating Theatre
* Basic correlation (anomaly ↔ recent change)
* CLI: `sysobs status`, `sysobs ingest`, `sysobs query`

== Phase 3 — Dashboard

Deliverables:

* Web-based dashboard (ReScript + Deno)
* Real-time system health view
* Historical trends
* Change timeline with annotations

== Phase 4 — Forecasting

Deliverables:

* Julia analytics for trend prediction
* "Disk full in N days" warnings
* Pattern recognition
* Proactive alerts

== Phase 5 — Integrations

Deliverables:

* Ward: provide System Weather data
* PSA: trend alerts for preventive action
* Operating Theatre: receive run bundles, emit recommendations
* feedback-a-tron: alert routing

== Technology decisions

|===
| Component | Language | Rationale

| Core daemon
| Elixir
| Observability is allowed Elixir use case; supervision trees

| Analytics/forecasting
| Julia
| Batch data processing per RSR

| Dashboard UI
| ReScript + Deno
| AmbientOps primary stack

| Metrics store
| PostgreSQL or SQLite
| Simple, proven; NOT source of truth
|===

== Constraints

System Observatory MUST:

* Only observe, never mutate
* Only recommend, never apply
* Only cache, never be authoritative
* Stay strictly optional in the ecosystem
