== The Problem

You've been there:

* Account compromised, don't know what was accessed
* Firewall wide open, no idea which ports are safe to close
* Services running as root that don't need to be
* World-writable files everywhere
* Haven't checked for updates in months
* SSH configured with password authentication (bad practice)
* SELinux/AppArmor disabled "because it was easier"
* Failed login attempts in logs, no idea if it's serious
* SSL certificates expired, breaking services

You search for security guides. You find 200-page CIS benchmarks. You don't know which settings matter. Some advice is outdated. You're afraid of locking yourself out.

**Security Ambulance solves this.**

== What It Does

Security Ambulance provides *systematic, expert-level security assessment and hardening* for Linux systems—without requiring you to be a security expert.

=== 🔍 Comprehensive Security Audit

Security Ambulance checks *everything* that affects your security posture:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Area |What It Checks

|**Firewall**
|Open ports, unsafe rules, default deny policy, port exposure, failed connection attempts

|**Services**
|Unnecessary services running, services running as root, unpatched daemons, listening ports

|**File Permissions**
|World-writable files, SUID/SGID binaries, sensitive config permissions, SSH key permissions, /tmp safety

|**Users & Groups**
|Password policy strength, sudo access, inactive accounts, UID 0 accounts, password aging

|**Updates**
|Missing security patches, kernel version, outdated packages, auto-update configuration

|**Access Control**
|SELinux/AppArmor status, mandatory access control policies, enforcement mode

|**Malware Detection**
|Rootkit signatures, suspicious processes, unauthorized SUID binaries, hidden files, modified system binaries

|**Logs**
|Failed login attempts, privilege escalation attempts, suspicious network activity, log tampering

|**Certificates**
|Expired TLS/SSL certificates, weak cipher suites, certificate validation, self-signed certs

|**SSH Hardening**
|Password authentication, root login, key-only auth, port configuration, protocol version
|===

=== 🔧 Safe, Auditable Hardening

When Security Ambulance finds vulnerabilities, it can fix them—*safely*:

* **Firewall hardening**: Close unnecessary ports, add rate limiting, enable default deny, block known bad IPs
* **Service hardening**: Disable unnecessary services, enforce principle of least privilege, restrict service capabilities
* **Permission fixes**: Fix world-writable files, secure SUID binaries, harden SSH keys, protect config files
* **Access control**: Enable SELinux/AppArmor, configure policies, enforce mandatory access control
* **SSH hardening**: Disable password auth, enforce key-based authentication, disable root login, change default port
* **Update management**: Install security patches, configure auto-updates, verify package signatures

Every hardening action:

* ✓ Shows you what it will do *before* doing it (dry-run mode)
* ✓ Creates automatic backups of modified configs
* ✓ Generates compliance receipts (CIS, NIST, DISA STIG)
* ✓ Can be undone if something breaks
* ✓ Never weakens security without explicit approval

== Quick Start

=== Installation

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/security-ambulance.git
cd security-ambulance
sudo ./install.sh
----

Or download and install in one command:

[source,bash]
----
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperpolymath/security-ambulance/main/install.sh | sudo bash
----

=== Basic Usage

==== Run Full Security Audit

[source,bash]
----
sudo security-audit scan
----

This shows you *everything* about your security posture: firewall rules, running services, file permissions, user accounts, updates, SELinux status, malware indicators, logs, certificates.

Sample output:

[source,text]
----
[✓] Firewall: active (ufw), default deny incoming
[✗] Port 22 (SSH) exposed to 0.0.0.0 (RISK)
[✗] Port 3306 (MySQL) exposed to 0.0.0.0 (CRITICAL)
[✓] Services: 23 running, 4 unnecessary services detected
[✗] Service 'cups' running as root (unnecessary)
[✗] 47 world-writable files detected (RISK)
[✗] 12 SUID binaries detected (review recommended)
[!] SELinux: disabled (SECURITY RISK)
[✗] 127 failed SSH login attempts from 34.56.78.90
[✓] All SSL certificates valid
[!] WARNING: SSH password authentication enabled (RISK)
----

==== Auto-Harden Everything

If you trust Security Ambulance to fix everything it found:

[source,bash]
----
sudo security-audit auto-harden
----

==== Guided Hardening (Recommended)

For more control, use interactive mode:

[source,bash]
----
sudo security-audit harden --interactive
----

This walks you through each issue and asks what you want to do:

[source,text]
----
Issue: SSH password authentication enabled (allows brute-force attacks)

Suggested hardening: Disable password authentication in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Requires: SSH keys configured for all users

[Y] Apply this fix
[S] Skip
[D] Show details
[Q] Quit

Your choice:
----

==== Target Specific Security Areas

Fix just firewall issues:

[source,bash]
----
sudo security-audit harden firewall
----

Fix just file permissions:

[source,bash]
----
sudo security-audit harden permissions
----

Other targets: `services`, `users`, `updates`, `selinux`, `ssh`, `malware`, `certificates`

==== Dry-Run Mode

See what *would* be changed without actually changing it:

[source,bash]
----
sudo security-audit harden --dry-run
----

Perfect for understanding risks or verifying before production changes.

==== Compliance Reporting

Generate CIS Benchmark compliance report:

[source,bash]
----
sudo security-audit compliance --benchmark cis
----

Other benchmarks: `nist`, `disa-stig`, `pci-dss`

== Real-World Scenarios

=== Scenario 1: "I Think My Account Was Compromised"

Suspicious activity detected, need to assess damage and lock down.

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo security-audit scan malware

[✗] Rootkit detected: possible linux-rootkit-4 signatures
[✗] Suspicious process: /tmp/.hidden/miner (high CPU)
[✗] Unauthorized SUID binary: /usr/local/bin/.backdoor
[✗] Modified system binary: /bin/ps (checksum mismatch)
[!] 847 failed login attempts from 12 unique IPs

== Part of AmbientOps

Security Ambulance is a *procedure pack* in the link:https://github.com/hyperpolymath/ambientops[AmbientOps ecosystem], which uses a "hospital model" for system tools:

* **Ward** — Daily ambient system health ("System Weather")
* **Emergency Room** — Panic-safe emergency diagnostics
* **Operating Room** — Planned procedures (Security Ambulance lives here)
* **Records** — Receipts, undo tokens, compliance reports

Security Ambulance integrates with:

* **Operating Theatre** for security procedure orchestration
* **Ward** for surfacing security health signals (exposed ports, failed logins)
* **Emergency Room** for security incidents (quick compromise assessment)
* **Records** for generating compliance reports and incident bundles

See `docs/AMBIENTOPS_INTEGRATION.adoc` for details.

== Safety Guarantees

Security Ambulance follows *AmbientOps safety principles*:

=== ✓ Evidence-First, Not Fearware

No "9,847 CRITICAL THREATS DETECTED" scareware. Security Ambulance shows you *actual risks*, not hype.

Instead of: "Your system is 99% vulnerable! Buy premium now!"

You get: "Port 3306 (MySQL) exposed to 0.0.0.0 with no password. CIS Benchmark 3.5.2 violation. Recommendation: restrict to localhost."

=== ✓ Non-Destructive by Default

Security audits are *completely read-only*. No changes without your approval.

Hardening actions:

* Create automatic timestamped backups of all modified files
* Prefer additive security (add rules, don't delete config)
* Never lock you out (verify SSH keys before disabling passwords)
* Provide undo receipts for all changes

=== ✓ Explicit Approval Required

No silent changes. Every hardening action shows:

* What it will do
* Why it's a security risk
* What compliance standards it violates
* How to undo it
* What could break

You approve each change (or use `--yes` if you're confident).

=== ✓ Never Opens Security Holes

Security Ambulance will **NEVER**:

* Weaken existing security controls
* Disable firewalls or access controls
* Create new attack surfaces
* Expose services to public internet without explicit consent
* Disable SELinux/AppArmor without strong justification
* Store passwords or credentials
* Reduce password complexity requirements
* Open backdoors or "remote assistance" ports

=== ✓ Compliance-Aware

Security Ambulance understands industry standards:

* CIS Benchmarks (Center for Internet Security)
* NIST Cybersecurity Framework
* DISA STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guides)
* PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry)
* HIPAA Security Rule

All recommendations cite specific compliance requirements.

=== ✓ Works Offline

Security Ambulance doesn't require internet to audit or harden systems.

All security checks and most hardening actions work *completely offline*.

----
sudo security-audit export --incident /tmp/security-incident
----

Creates:

[source,text]
----
/tmp/security-incident/
├── audit-report.txt         # Full audit output
├── system-info.txt          # OS, kernel, hardware
├── security-configs/        # Config files (sanitized)
│   ├── sshd_config
│   ├── firewall-rules
│   ├── pam.d/
│   └── selinux/
├── logs/                    # Security logs

----

=== Requirements

* D compiler (ldc2 or dmd) for orchestration
* V compiler for policy verification
* Rust toolchain for cryptographic operations
* Standard Linux utilities: `iptables`, `systemctl`, `auditctl`
* Root/sudo for scanning and hardening

=== Implementation Languages

Security Ambulance uses a multi-language architecture per Rhodium Standard Repository (RSR) guidelines:

* **D** — Core orchestration, system interaction (robust, cross-distro)
* **V** — Security policy verification (fast, memory-safe)
* **Rust** — Cryptographic operations (safety-critical, no undefined behavior)

This ensures:

* Type safety (no memory corruption vulnerabilities)
* Performance (native compiled, no runtime overhead)
* Correctness (formal verification of security policies)
* Auditability (clear separation of concerns)

== Why Security Ambulance?

=== vs. Manual Security Guides

|===
|Manual Hardening |Security Ambulance

|Read 200-page CIS Benchmark
|One command

|Manually check 147 settings
|Automated comprehensive scan

|Hope you didn't miss anything
|Evidence-based audit

|No undo if you break something
|Automatic backups + undo

|"Last updated: 2019"
|Current compliance standards

|Might lock yourself out
|Verifies access before changes
|===

=== vs. Commercial Security Scanners

Those expensive enterprise tools?

* They generate 10,000-line reports with 90% false positives
* They require annual licenses and "professional services"
* They have opaque algorithms (you can't audit them)
* They want to "phone home" and upload your data
* They cost $10,000+ per year

Security Ambulance:

* ✓ Open source (audit the code yourself)
* ✓ No telemetry, no tracking, no data upload
* ✓ No "enterprise licenses" or vendor lock-in
* ✓ Evidence-based, no fake threats
* ✓ Compliance-aware (CIS, NIST, DISA STIG)
* ✓ Free forever

=== vs. "PC Optimizer" Malware

Those sketchy "Scan your PC for threats!" tools?

* They ARE the malware
* They lie about problems to scare you
* They open security holes
* They install adware/ransomware
* They steal credentials

Security Ambulance:

* ✓ Open source (review the code)
* ✓ Never weakens security
* ✓ Never installs anything suspicious
* ✓ Evidence-based, no fake errors
* ✓ Safety-first design

=== vs. Learning Everything Yourself

Learning security is great, but when your server is compromised at 2am and you have customers affected, you don't have time for a security certification course.

Security Ambulance is *teaching-friendly*:

* Explains security risks in plain English
* Shows the exact commands it runs
* Documents why each hardening action works
* Cites compliance standards (CIS, NIST)
* References are included (learn at your own pace)

You can learn while fixing, not instead of fixing.
