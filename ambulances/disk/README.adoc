*Your disk is acting weird. Disk Ambulance diagnoses and repairs filesystem issues before you lose data.*

Disk Ambulance is a comprehensive diagnostic and repair tool for Linux disk health, filesystem integrity, and storage performance issues. Unlike random forum advice or dangerous "optimizer" tools, it provides *safe, documented, reversible* disk repairs with *full evidence trails*.

"Your filesystem just went read-only. You have unsaved work. You don't need a sysadmin certification—you need Disk Ambulance."
____

== The Problem

You've been there:

* "Disk full" error despite deleting gigabytes
* Filesystem suddenly mounted read-only
* SMART errors appearing in logs
* System freezes during disk I/O
* `fsck` errors on boot that you clicked through
* "Cannot create file: No space left on device" with plenty of space
* Slow disk performance for no apparent reason
* Mysterious "Input/output error" messages

You search forums. You find advice from 2012 about running `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda` (don't do this). Half the solutions assume you have backups. Some will destroy your data. You don't know which to trust.

**Disk Ambulance solves this.**

== What It Does

Disk Ambulance provides *systematic, expert-level diagnostics and repairs* for common Linux disk and filesystem failures—without requiring you to be a storage expert.

=== 🔍 Comprehensive Diagnostics

Disk Ambulance checks *everything* that can affect disk health and filesystem integrity:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Area |What It Checks

|**SMART Health**
|Drive temperature, reallocated sectors, pending sectors, uncorrectable errors, power-on hours, spin-up time, seek errors

|**Filesystem Integrity**
|Superblock validity, inode table corruption, journal status, filesystem consistency, free space accuracy

|**Mount State**
|Mount options, read-only remounts, mount point accessibility, fstab consistency, orphaned mount points

|**Disk Space**
|Actual vs. reported free space, inode exhaustion, reserved blocks, quota limits, hidden space consumers

|**I/O Performance**
|Read/write latency, queue depth, I/O scheduler, sustained throughput, random vs. sequential performance

|**Physical Health**
|Bad sector mapping, read error rate, spin retry count, reported uncorrectable errors, wear leveling (SSD)

|**RAID Status**
|Array health, degraded arrays, rebuild progress, sync status, failed disks, spare activation

|**SSD Health**
|Wear leveling count, total bytes written, remaining lifetime, TRIM support, over-provisioning
|===

=== 🔧 Safe, Documented Repairs

When Disk Ambulance finds problems, it can fix them—*safely*:

* **Filesystem repairs**: Safe fsck execution, journal replay, superblock recovery, inode table rebuild
* **Space recovery**: Find and clean disk space hogs, quota fixes, reserved block adjustment, orphaned file cleanup
* **Mount repairs**: Fix mount options, recover from read-only state, repair fstab entries, remount with correct options
* **SMART handling**: Acknowledge SMART warnings, trigger self-tests, handle reallocated sectors, firmware bug workarounds
* **RAID repairs**: Re-add failed disks, start rebuilds, sync arrays, activate spares, repair metadata
* **SSD optimization**: Enable TRIM, trigger garbage collection, optimize mount options, check alignment

Every repair:

* ✓ Shows you what it will do *before* doing it (dry-run mode)
* ✓ Creates automatic backups (filesystem metadata, partition tables, RAID configs)
* ✓ Generates receipts for audit trails
* ✓ Can be undone if something goes wrong
* ✓ **NEVER touches user data without explicit consent**

== Quick Start

=== Installation

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/disk-ambulance.git
cd disk-ambulance
sudo ./install.sh
----

Or download and install in one command:

[source,bash]
----
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperpolymath/disk-ambulance/main/install.sh | sudo bash
----

=== Basic Usage

==== Run Full Diagnostics

[source,bash]
----
disk-repair diagnose
----

This shows you *everything* about your disk health: SMART status, filesystem integrity, mount state, space usage, I/O performance, RAID health.

Sample output:

[source,text]
----
[✓] /dev/nvme0n1: SMART OK, 127 days power-on, 0 reallocated sectors
[✗] /dev/sda: 5 reallocated sectors (WARNING)
[✓] /dev/sda: Temperature 42°C (normal)
[✓] /: ext4 mounted rw, 78% used (372G free)
[✗] /home: XFS mounted ro (READ-ONLY - PROBLEM)
[!] /home: Filesystem consistency check needed
[✗] /dev/md0: RAID1 degraded (1/2 disks active)
[✓] SSD /dev/nvme0n1: TRIM enabled, 94% lifetime remaining
----

==== Auto-Repair Everything

If you trust Disk Ambulance to fix everything it found:

[source,bash]
----
sudo disk-repair auto-repair
----

==== Guided Repair (Recommended)

For more control, use interactive mode:

[source,bash]
----
sudo disk-repair repair --interactive
----

This walks you through each issue and asks what you want to do:

[source,text]
----
Issue: Filesystem /home is mounted read-only (likely due to I/O errors)

Suggested repair: Unmount /home, run fsck.xfs, remount read-write

Impact: Users cannot access /home during repair (estimated 5-15 minutes)
Risk: Low (read-only check first, then repair)

[Y] Apply this fix
[S] Skip
[D] Show details
[Q] Quit

Your choice:
----

==== Target Specific Problems

Fix just filesystem issues:

[source,bash]
----
sudo disk-repair repair filesystems
----

Check SMART health only:

[source,bash]
----
disk-repair diagnose smart
----

Other targets: `space`, `mounts`, `raid`, `ssd`, `performance`

==== Dry-Run Mode

See what *would* be changed without actually changing it:

[source,bash]
----
sudo disk-repair repair --dry-run
----

Perfect for understanding what's wrong or verifying before production changes.

== Real-World Scenarios

=== Scenario 1: "Filesystem Suddenly Read-Only"

This happens when the kernel detects I/O errors and protects your data by remounting read-only.

[source,bash]
----
$ disk-repair diagnose filesystems

[✗] /home: ext4 mounted ro (filesystem errors detected)
[!] Kernel log shows: "EXT4-fs error: I/O failure writing to journal"
[!] SMART: 3 pending sectors on /dev/sdb

$ sudo disk-repair repair filesystems --target /home

Checking SMART status of /dev/sdb... 3 pending sectors
Recommendation: Trigger SMART self-test first

Running SMART short self-test on /dev/sdb... (2 minutes)
Self-test complete: 3 sectors reallocated successfully
No new pending sectors detected

Unmounting /home...
Running fsck.ext4 (read-only check first)...
Found: 2 orphaned inodes, 1 corrupted journal entry
Severity: MEDIUM (repairable without data loss)

Proceed with repair? [y/N]: y

Running fsck.ext4 -p (automatic safe repairs)...
✓ Orphaned inodes reconnected to lost+found
✓ Journal replayed successfully
✓ Filesystem consistency verified

Remounting /home read-write...
Testing write access... SUCCESS

[✓] /home repaired and remounted read-write
----

=== Scenario 2: "Disk Full But It Shouldn't Be"

Common culprits: deleted files held open by processes, inode exhaustion, hidden reserved space.

[source,bash]
----
$ disk-repair diagnose space

[✓] /: 2.1TB total, 189GB free (91% used)
[✗] /var: 50GB total, 0B free (100% used - PROBLEM)
[!] /var: 12GB held by deleted files (still open by processes)
[!] /var: 8GB in /var/log (log rotation not working)

$ sudo disk-repair repair space --target /var

Found space consumers:
  1. 12GB: Deleted files held open by processes
     - 8GB: /var/log/syslog (deleted, held by rsyslogd)
     - 4GB: /var/lib/docker/... (deleted, held by dockerd)
  2. 8GB: /var/log/*.log (old log files, rotation failed)
  3. 4GB: /var/cache/apt/archives (old package files)

Repair plan:
  1. Restart rsyslogd to release deleted log files (12GB)
  2. Truncate /var/log/*.log files >1GB (8GB)
  3. Clean apt cache (4GB)
  Total recovery: ~24GB

Proceed? [y/N]: y

Restarting rsyslog... done (12GB freed)
Truncating large log files... done (8GB freed)
Cleaning apt cache... done (4GB freed)

[✓] /var: 50GB total, 24GB free (52% used)
----

=== Scenario 3: "SMART Errors in Logs"

SMART warnings mean your disk is failing. Act fast.

[source,bash]
----
$ disk-repair diagnose smart

[✗] /dev/sda: 24 reallocated sectors (FAILING)
[✗] /dev/sda: 8 pending sectors (CRITICAL)
[!] /dev/sda: Predicted failure within 24 hours
[!] Drive model: WDC WD20EFRX (known firmware bug WD-201)

$ sudo disk-repair repair smart --target /dev/sda

CRITICAL: This drive is failing and should be replaced IMMEDIATELY.

Disk Ambulance can:
  1. Run extended SMART test (forces reallocation of pending sectors)
  2. Mark bad sectors in filesystem (prevent data writes to bad areas)
  3. Create backup plan (identify critical data for migration)

This is NOT a permanent fix. REPLACE THIS DRIVE ASAP.

Proceed with emergency stabilization? [y/N]: y

Running SMART extended test... (90 minutes)
Extended test complete: 6/8 pending sectors reallocated
Remaining 2 pending sectors: UNCORRECTABLE (permanent damage)

Scanning filesystems on /dev/sda for affected files...
Found: 3 files in bad sectors:
  /home/user/old-downloads/video.mp4 (corrupted)
  /var/cache/... (safe to delete)
  /home/user/documents/report.docx (CRITICAL - backup now!)

Creating recovery bundle: /tmp/disk-sda-recovery.tar.gz
  ✓ List of affected files
  ✓ SMART logs
  ✓ Filesystem metadata
  ✓ Recommended replacement drives

[!] ACTION REQUIRED:
  1. Backup /home/user/documents/report.docx NOW
  2. Order replacement drive (recommendations in recovery bundle)
  3. Plan data migration (use disk-ambulance migrate when ready)

[✓] Emergency stabilization complete (drive still FAILING)
----

=== Scenario 4: "RAID Array Degraded"

One disk failed in a RAID array—don't panic.

[source,bash]
----
$ disk-repair diagnose raid

[✗] /dev/md0: RAID1 degraded (1/2 disks active)
[!] /dev/sdb removed from array (too many I/O errors)
[✓] /dev/sda: active, healthy
[!] Array is vulnerable (no redundancy until rebuilt)

$ sudo disk-repair repair raid --target md0

RAID /dev/md0 is degraded:
  Active: /dev/sda (healthy)
  Failed: /dev/sdb (removed due to errors)

Options:
  1. Re-add /dev/sdb (if errors were temporary)
  2. Replace /dev/sdb with new drive
  3. Run with degraded array (NOT RECOMMENDED)

Checking /dev/sdb health...
  SMART: 127 reallocated sectors (FAILING DRIVE)
  Recommendation: REPLACE, do not re-add

You need to:
  1. Physically install replacement drive
  2. Partition new drive identically to /dev/sda
  3. Run: disk-repair raid-add-disk /dev/md0 /dev/sdX

Monitoring mode: Alert when array rebuild needed

[✓] RAID status documented, monitoring enabled
----

=== Scenario 5: "Slow Disk Performance"

Everything works but it's painfully slow.

[source,bash]
----
$ disk-repair diagnose performance

[✗] /dev/sda: Sequential read: 45 MB/s (expected 120 MB/s for SATA)
[✗] /dev/sda: Random read latency: 180ms (expected 8-12ms)
[!] I/O scheduler: 'cfq' (not optimal for this drive)
[!] Mount option: 'relatime' (noatime would improve performance)
[✓] /dev/nvme0n1: Sequential read: 3200 MB/s (expected 3500 MB/s - OK)
[✗] /dev/nvme0n1: TRIM not running (degraded SSD performance)

$ sudo disk-repair repair performance

Performance optimizations available:
  1. Change I/O scheduler: cfq → mq-deadline (better for SATA)
  2. Enable noatime mount option (reduce write overhead)
  3. Enable periodic TRIM for SSD (restore write performance)
  4. Adjust read-ahead buffer (optimize for workload)

Apply optimizations? [y/N]: y

Changing I/O scheduler for /dev/sda... done
Adding noatime to /etc/fstab for /... done
Enabling weekly TRIM timer for /dev/nvme0n1... done
Adjusting read-ahead to 8192KB... done

Running performance test...
  /dev/sda: Sequential read: 118 MB/s (was 45 MB/s - IMPROVED)
  /dev/nvme0n1: TRIM completed, 94GB reclaimed

[✓] Performance optimizations applied

== Part of AmbientOps

Disk Ambulance is a *procedure pack* in the link:https://github.com/hyperpolymath/ambientops[AmbientOps ecosystem], which uses a "hospital model" for system tools:

* **Ward** — Daily ambient system health ("System Weather")
* **Emergency Room** — Panic-safe emergency diagnostics
* **Operating Room** — Planned procedures (Disk Ambulance lives here)
* **Records** — Receipts, undo tokens, shareable help bundles

Disk Ambulance integrates with:

* **Operating Theatre** for procedure orchestration
* **Ward** for surfacing disk health signals (SMART warnings, space alerts)
* **Emergency Room** for disk emergencies (immediate triage, read-only filesystems)
* **Records** for generating shareable incident bundles

See `docs/AMBIENTOPS_INTEGRATION.adoc` for details.

== Safety Guarantees

Disk Ambulance follows *AmbientOps safety principles*:

=== ✓ Evidence-First, Not Fearware

No "1,847 CRITICAL DISK ERRORS" scareware. Disk Ambulance shows you *measurements*, not hype.

Instead of: "Your disk is 99% failed!"

You get: "5 reallocated sectors detected (normal wear: <20, failing threshold: >100). Current status: MONITOR. Predicted failure: >6 months. Recommendation: schedule replacement during next maintenance window."

=== ✓ Non-Destructive by Default

Diagnostics are *completely read-only*. No changes without your approval.

Repairs:

* Create automatic timestamped backups (filesystem metadata, partition tables, configs)
* Prefer read-only checks before repairs (fsck -n, then fsck -p if safe)
* **NEVER touch user data without explicit consent**
* Provide undo receipts for all changes

=== ✓ Explicit Approval Required

No silent changes. Every repair shows:

* What it will do (exact commands)
* Why it's needed (root cause)
* What can go wrong (risk assessment)
* How to undo it (rollback procedure)
* Estimated downtime (if any)

You approve each change (or use `--yes` if you're confident).

=== ✓ Never Destroys Data

Disk Ambulance will **NEVER**:

* Format drives without triple-confirmation
* Delete user files without explicit consent
* Run destructive fsck without read-only check first
* Execute `dd`, `shred`, or data destruction commands
* Make partition table changes without backup
* Force-mount corrupted filesystems (leads to data loss)

=== ✓ Works Offline

Disk Ambulance doesn't require internet to diagnose or repair disk problems.

All diagnostics and repairs work *completely offline*.

=== ✓ SMART-Aware Safety

Disk Ambulance checks SMART status *before* any repair:

* If drive is failing → refuse repairs, suggest data migration
* If pending sectors exist → force reallocation first, then repair filesystem
* If temperature critical → wait for cooling, don't stress drive further

== Advanced Features

=== Export Incident Bundles

Generate a shareable diagnostic bundle for forums/support:

[source,bash]
----
disk-repair export --bundle /tmp/disk-issue
----

Creates:

[source,text]
----
/tmp/disk-issue/
├── diagnostics.txt       # Full diagnostic output
├── system-info.txt       # OS, kernel, hardware
├── smart-reports/        # SMART data for all drives
│   ├── nvme0n1.txt
│   └── sda.txt
├── filesystem-info/      # Filesystem metadata
│   ├── fstab
│   ├── mounts
│   └── df-output.txt
├── logs/                 # Relevant logs
│   ├── dmesg-disk-errors.log
│   └── kern.log-io-errors
└── metadata.json         # Machine-readable summary
----

The bundle *automatically sanitizes* sensitive info (usernames, paths if requested).

=== Backup Management

List all backups:

[source,bash]
----
disk-repair list-backups
----

Restore from backup:

[source,bash]
----
sudo disk-repair restore --backup 2026-01-29_14-30-22
----

----

=== Requirements

* D compiler (DMD or LDC) for orchestration
* Rust compiler for safety-critical repairs
* Standard Linux utilities: `smartctl`, `fsck`, `df`, `lsblk`
* Optional: `mdadm` (RAID), `btrfs` (Btrfs), `xfs_repair` (XFS)
* Root/sudo for repairs (diagnostics work without root for some checks)

=== Implementation Language

Disk Ambulance uses a *hybrid implementation*:

* **D** for core orchestration (robust, cross-distro, good error handling)
* **Rust** for safety-critical filesystem operations (memory safety, no data corruption)
* **Bash** for simple wrappers and system integration

This follows Rhodium Standard Repository (RSR) guidelines.

=== Safety-Critical Operations (Rust)

The following operations are implemented in Rust for maximum safety:

* Filesystem metadata backup/restore
* Partition table reading/writing
* RAID metadata operations
* Direct device I/O (when needed)
* Filesystem repair orchestration (calls fsck but validates results)

== Why Disk Ambulance?

=== vs. Manual Forum Fixes

|===
|Manual Fixes |Disk Ambulance

|Search 20 forum threads
|One command

|Copy-paste random fsck commands
|Safe, tested procedures

|Hope you backed up first
|Automatic backups before changes

|No undo if it breaks
|Automatic backups + undo

|"Worked for me on Ubuntu 14.04"
|Works on modern distros + filesystems

|Might destroy all your data
|Safety-first design
|===

=== vs. "Disk Optimizer" Tools

Those sketchy "Fix your disk!" tools?

* They lie about problems to scare you
* They "defragment" your SSD (harmful and pointless)
* They install adware/spyware
* They want your credit card
* They might actually corrupt your filesystem

Disk Ambulance:

* ✓ Open source (review the code)
* ✓ No telemetry, no tracking
* ✓ No "premium upsells"
* ✓ Evidence-based, no fake errors
* ✓ Safety-first design
* ✓ Never touches your data without permission

=== vs. Learning Everything Yourself

Learning storage systems is great, but when your filesystem just went read-only and you have unsaved work, you don't have time for a kernel internals course.

Disk Ambulance is *teaching-friendly*:

* Explains what it finds in plain English
* Shows the commands it runs
* Documents why each fix works
* Includes references to man pages and documentation
* Links to in-depth guides for learning more

You can learn while fixing, not instead of fixing.
