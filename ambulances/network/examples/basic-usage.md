# Basic Usage Examples

This document provides common usage examples for the Complete Linux Internet Repair Tool.

## Quick Diagnostics

### Check All Network Issues

```bash
# Run complete diagnostics
network-repair diagnose
```

Output example:
```
=== Network Interface Check ===
→ Available network interfaces
  eth0
    Status: UP
    IP: 192.168.1.100
    MAC: 00:11:22:33:44:55

=== Routing Table Check ===
→ Checking default route
✓ Default route found
  Gateway: 192.168.1.1

=== DNS Configuration Check ===
→ Checking /etc/resolv.conf
✓ Found 2 nameserver(s)
```

### Check Specific Issues

```bash
# Check DNS only
network-repair diagnose-dns

# Check network interfaces only
network-repair diagnose-network

# Check routing only
network-repair diagnose-routing
```

## Basic Repairs

### Auto-Repair All Issues

```bash
# Diagnose and automatically repair
sudo network-repair --auto-repair diagnose
```

### Repair Specific Issues

```bash
# Fix DNS problems
sudo network-repair repair-dns

# Fix network interface issues
sudo network-repair repair-network

# Fix routing problems
sudo network-repair repair-routing
```

## Interactive Mode

### Guided Troubleshooting

```bash
# Launch interactive mode
sudo network-repair interactive
```

## Advanced Usage

### Verbose Output

```bash
# See detailed diagnostic information
network-repair --verbose diagnose
```

### Dry Run

```bash
# See what would be changed without making changes
sudo network-repair --dry-run repair
```

Output example:
```
[WARN] DRY RUN MODE - No changes will be made

=== DNS Configuration Repair ===
→ Would add DNS servers to /etc/resolv.conf
→ Would restart systemd-resolved
```

### Logging to File

```bash
# Save detailed logs
network-repair --log-file /tmp/network-repair.log diagnose

# View the log
cat /tmp/network-repair.log
```

### Quiet Mode

```bash
# Show only errors
network-repair --quiet diagnose
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Internet After System Update

```bash
# Step 1: Diagnose the issue
network-repair diagnose

# Step 2: If DNS or routing issues found, auto-repair
sudo network-repair --auto-repair diagnose
```

### Scenario 2: DNS Not Resolving

```bash
# Check DNS
network-repair diagnose-dns

# Fix DNS
sudo network-repair repair-dns

# Verify fix
ping google.com
```

### Scenario 3: Interface is Down

```bash
# Check interfaces
network-repair diagnose-network

# Bring up interfaces and renew DHCP
sudo network-repair repair-network

# Verify
ip addr show
```

### Scenario 4: No Default Route

```bash
# Check routing
network-repair diagnose-routing

# Fix routing
sudo network-repair repair-routing

# Verify
ip route show
```

### Scenario 5: NetworkManager Issues

```bash
# Check NetworkManager
network-repair diagnose-all

# Repair NetworkManager
sudo network-repair repair-all

# Or use interactive mode for guided repair
sudo network-repair interactive
```

## Working with Backups

### View Backups

```bash
# List all backups
ls -lh ~/.network-repair-backups/
```

### Restore from Backup

```bash
# Manually restore a backup
sudo cp ~/.network-repair-backups/resolv.conf.20250122_143052 /etc/resolv.conf
```

## Configuration

### Using Environment Variables

```bash
# Enable verbose mode
VERBOSE=true network-repair diagnose

# Change log level
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG network-repair diagnose

# Use custom DNS servers
DEFAULT_DNS_SERVERS="8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1" sudo network-repair repair-dns

# Change backup directory
BACKUP_DIR=/tmp/backups sudo network-repair repair
```

### Using Configuration File

Edit `/opt/network-repair/config/defaults.conf` (after installation):

```bash
# Enable logging to file
LOG_TO_FILE=true
LOG_FILE=/var/log/network-repair.log

# Enable verbose output by default
VERBOSE=true

# Always run in interactive mode
INTERACTIVE=true
```

## Troubleshooting the Tool

### Permission Denied

```bash
# Make sure you're using sudo for repairs
sudo network-repair repair

# Check file permissions
ls -l /opt/network-repair/
```

### Command Not Found

```bash
# If not installed, run directly
./network-repair diagnose

# Or install it
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Getting Help

```bash
# View help
network-repair --help

# View version
network-repair --version
```

## Integration with Other Tools

### Using in Scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example: Check network before running backup

if ! network-repair diagnose >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Network issues detected, attempting repair..."
    sudo network-repair --auto-repair diagnose
fi

# Proceed with backup
./backup.sh
```

### Cron Job for Monitoring

```bash
# Add to crontab: Check network every hour
0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/network-repair diagnose --quiet || /usr/local/bin/network-repair --auto-repair repair
```

### Systemd Service

Create `/etc/systemd/system/network-repair-monitor.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Network Repair Monitor
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/network-repair diagnose
ExecStartPost=/bin/sh -c 'if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then /usr/local/bin/network-repair --auto-repair repair; fi'

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable network-repair-monitor.service
sudo systemctl start network-repair-monitor.service
```
