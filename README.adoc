Unified monorepo for system monitoring, recovery, and ambulance tooling.

toc::[]

== Overview

system-tools consolidates eleven previously separate repositories into a
single, coherent monorepo organised by function:

* *monitoring/* - Continuous system observation and alerting (observatory, systems-observatory, flare)
* *recovery/* - Active intervention when systems fail (emergency-room, operating-theatre, freeze-ejector)
* *ambulances/* - Domain-specific diagnostic and repair agents (disk, network, performance, security)
* *contracts/* - Shared interfaces and type contracts across all tools

== Component Origins

Each subdirectory was imported from a standalone repository:

|===
| Original Repository | Monorepo Location

| system-observatory       | monitoring/observatory/
| systems-observatory      | monitoring/systems-observatory/
| system-flare             | monitoring/flare/
| system-emergency-room    | recovery/emergency-room/
| system-operating-theatre | recovery/operating-theatre/
| system-freeze-ejector    | recovery/freeze-ejector/
| disk-ambulance           | ambulances/disk/
| network-ambulance        | ambulances/network/
| performance-ambulance    | ambulances/performance/
| security-ambulance       | ambulances/security/
| system-tools-contracts   | contracts/
|===

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
just --list
just monitoring-observatory
just recovery-emergency-room
just ambulance-disk
----

== Architecture

The contracts/ directory defines shared interfaces that all components implement.
This ensures consistent behaviour across monitoring, recovery, and ambulance tools.

Each ambulance can operate independently or be orchestrated through the recovery
components (emergency-room for triage, operating-theatre for deep repairs).
